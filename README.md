Some Jupyter notebooks helpful for visualising dry, moist and pseudomoist adiabatic atmospheric profiles in DryThermo.ipynb and MoistThermo.ipynb. 
Radiative_Transfer.ipynb is some simple visualisations of black body spectra and cumulative energy integrals across the spectrum.
StreamFunctionPlotter.ipynb is a contour plotter for streamfunctions in fluid mechanics. It includes a feature to plot how a streamfunction changes over time that can be useful for time evolving systems. 

Most of these weren't written with the intention for them to be read by others. Hopefully the relevant use cases for each of the functions is clear enough for these to be of some benefit
