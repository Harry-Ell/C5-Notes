# Jupyter Notebooks Overview
This repository includes several Jupyter notebooks designed to assist with various atmospheric and fluid mechanics visualizations from C5 Atmospheric Physics course at Oxford.

## Notebooks
- DryThermo.ipynb and MoistThermo.ipynb: Visualize dry, moist, and pseudomoist adiabatic atmospheric profiles, aiding in the understanding of atmospheric thermodynamics.

- Radiative_Transfer.ipynb: Simple visualizations of black body spectra and cumulative energy integrals across the spectrum, useful for studying radiative transfer.

- StreamFunctionPlotter.ipynb: Contour plotter for streamfunctions in fluid mechanics, including features for visualizing time evolution in fluid systems.

## Purpose and Utility
While originally created for personal use, these notebooks may be of some use getting to grips with the equations in atmospheric physics and fluid mechanics. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
